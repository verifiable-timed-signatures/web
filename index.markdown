title: Verifiable Timed Signatures

## About

Verifiable Timed Signature (VTS) scheme allows one to time-lock a signature on a
known message for a given amount of time *T* such that after performing a sequential
computation for time *T* anyone can extract the signature from the time-lock.
*Verifiability* ensures that anyone can publicly check if a time-lock contains
a valid signature on the message without solving it first, and that the signature
can be obtained by solving the same for time *T*. This work formalizes VTS, presents
efficient constructions compatible with BLS, Schnorr, and ECDSA signatures, and
experimentally demonstrates that these constructions can be employed
in practice. On a technical level, we design an efficient cut-and-choose protocol
based on the homomorphic time-lock puzzles to prove the validity of a signature
encapsulated in a time-lock puzzle. We also present a new efficient range
proof protocol that significantly improves upon existing proposals in terms of
the proof size, and is also of independent interest. While VTS is a versatile tool
with numerous existing applications, we demonstrate VTSâ€™s applicability to
resolve three novel challenging issues in the space of cryptocurrencies.
Specifically, we show how VTS is the cryptographic cornerstone to construct: 
1. Payment channel networks with improved on-chain unlinkability of users involved
in a transaction 
2. Multi-party signing of transactions for cryptocurrencies without any on-chain notion of time 
3. Cryptocurrency-enabled fair multi-party computation protocol.
